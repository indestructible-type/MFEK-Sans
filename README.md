MFEK Sans is an original font created by indestructible type*. It is inspired by 
Wooden Type from the mid to late 1800s.

MFEK Sans is designed and maintained by [Owen Earl](https://ewonrael.github.io/), who is the creator of the font foundry [indestructible type*](http://indestructible-type.github.io).

About
-----
MFEK is designed to be highly versatile while also being highly expressive. This is
accomplished by designing it from the start to accommodate a large range of weights and
styles. Many historical wooden typefaces from the 1800s  were referenced with design
elements being drawn from many different families based off of their utility, and their
historical character. MFEK Sans was commissioned by the [Modular Font Editor K
Foundation](https://mfek.org/foundation/).

Changelog
---------
<b>v0.01</b>
Pre-Release.

Building
--------
Build scripts can be found inside the "sources" folder. To build, download and install the required software listed in the "requirements.txt" file before running the gen-sources.sh script and the build script that corresponds to your desired output (so if you want woff2 files run "build-woff2.sh")

Contributing
---------------
MFEK Sans is built and maintained using the open-source program [FontForge](https://fontforge.org), and by default will build the finished fonts using the FontForge files as sources. FontForge is free and cross platform, so it is possible for anyone looking to contribute to this project to use it to make modifications to the source files.

If you'd rather work with UFO files, simply run the "gen-sources.sh" shell script.
